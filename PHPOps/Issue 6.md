## [HashiCorp 2020 Year in Review](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/hashicorp-2020-year-in-review)

We’ve ended each of the last five years with a blog post on our reflections, highlighting the major milestones and achievements of HashiCorp. This year had many more challenges than we (and everyone) anticipated, and while we are glad the year is coming to an end, there is also much to celebrate and be proud of. As always, we are deeply thankful for our employees, users, customers, and partners who make it all possible.

## [With a $50B run rate in reach, can anyone stop AWS?](https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/with-a-50b-run-rate-in-reach-can-anyone-stop-aws/)

AWS, Amazon’s flourishing cloud arm, has been growing at a rapid clip for more than a decade. An early public cloud infrastructure vendor, it has taken advantage of first-to-market status to become the most successful player in the space. In fact, one could argue that many of today’s startups wouldn’t have gotten off the ground without the formation of cloud companies like AWS giving them easy access to infrastructure without having to build it themselves.

## [Interview with an anonymous AWS cybersecurity engineer](https://logicmag.io/commons/inside-the-whale-an-interview-with-an-anonymous-amazonian/)

Amazon is on a mission to own the infrastructure of our lives. The second-largest private employer in the United States after Walmart, the company captures $4 out of every $10 spent online. They have a vast network of fulfillment centers, and they are rapidly buying more real estate; in September 2020, they announced plans to open 1,500 more distribution hubs in suburbs across the country. Retail is only one of their many businesses, however: for many Americans, it would be impossible to commute from home to school or the office without passing into view of a Ring, Amazon’s “smart” home surveillance camera. Moreover, Amazon Web Services (AWS) controls nearly half of the public cloud market, and the company is pouring money into a number of other ventures, from entertainment to advertising. We talked with an AWS cybersecurity engineer about how to think about the behemoth and how it feels to work inside it.

## [Global load balancing with Kubernetes](https://atoonk.medium.com/global-load-balancing-with-kubernetes-1af66097e32a)

If you’re in the world of cloud infrastructure, then you’ve heard of Kubernetes. Some of you are experts already, while some of us are just learning or getting started. In this blog, we’ll introduce a mysocket controller for Kubernetes and demonstrate how easy it is to use mysocket.io as your cloud-delivered load balancer for your Kubernetes Services. If you’re a Kubernetes user already, then it should just take a minute to get this mysocket controller setup.

## [The Open Source Strategy of Amazon Web Services](https://thenewstack.io/the-open-source-strategy-of-amazon-web-services/)

Did you know that Amazon leads more than 1,200 open source projects on GitHub? Neither did I until I spoke last week with Matt Asay, the Head of Open Source Strategy and Marketing at Amazon Web Services (AWS). That number, which I got from the Open Source at AWS web page, was confirmed by Asay to represent “officially sponsored projects” — meaning they are open source projects that began inside of AWS, rather than being independent projects run by AWS employees.

## [Deploy your web app in AWS using Terraform](https://kvssankar.medium.com/deploy-your-web-app-in-aws-using-terraform-6d20755bd7b2)

## [Kubernetes: Ingress NGINX with automatic certificates with cert-manager using Let’s Encrypt](https://medium.com/@kimus.linuxus/kubernetes-ingress-nginx-with-automatic-certificates-with-cert-manager-using-lets-encrypt-f8a4fc79ca09)

## [Prometheus use as monitoring system](https://medium.com/cloud-belivers/prometheus-use-as-monitoring-system-fde9fdaa40eb)

Monitoring, as a part of the underlying infrastructure, is an indispensable part of ensuring the stability of production environment services. From discovery to location to resolution, online problems can effectively cover “discovery” and “location” through monitoring and warning methods. , It can even be solved by means of self-healing, service development and operation and maintenance personnel can find abnormalities in service operation in a timely and effective manner, so as to troubleshoot and solve problems more efficiently.

## [Getting started with Kubernetes](https://gtrekter.medium.com/getting-started-with-kubernetes-b0ac21c6f0ee)

Nowadays, when a client asks to create a highly available distributed system, Kubernetes has become the go-to choice. This resulted in a 69 percent use growth, according to the StackRox 2020 report. This article will give you a quick overview of Kubernetes. It’ll explain which problems it solves, how it works, and what its main components are. The concept behind Kubernetes is strictly related to Microservices, so I will summarize that as well to give you a bit of context.

## [2020: The year in databases at Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/databases/managed-cloud-database-services-what-was-new-in-2020)

2020 was a year unlike any other, and all its unexpectedness brought foundational enterprise technology into the spotlight. Businesses needed their databases to be reliable, scalable, and consistently well-performing. As a result, migration plans accelerated, rigid licensing fell further out of favor, and transformative application development sped up. This was clear even in 2019, when cloud database management system (DBMS) revenues were $17 billion, up 54% from 2018, according to Gartner Predicts. We’ll be eager to see what Gartner reports from 2020, but from our perspective, growth accelerated significantly this year.
