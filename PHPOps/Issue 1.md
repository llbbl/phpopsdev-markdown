# DevOps / SRE - Top Links Last Week

## Week 47 Issue #1

## [build.security Emerges From Stealth With Authorization Policy Management Platform](https://www.securityweek.com/buildsecurity-emerges-stealth-authorization-policy-management-platform)

The platform is designed to help developers eliminate potential vulnerabilities by providing full visibility into policy enforcement, fine-grained access controls, and decoupled logic. Developers can implement access policies using either a drag-and-drop policy builder or a declarative language (i.e. plain English).

## [The Tech Stack of a One-Man SaaS](https://panelbear.com/blog/tech-stack/)

Being an engineer at heart, each time I see a company write about their tech stack, I brew a fresh cup of coffee, sit back and enjoy reading the newfound little treat.

There’s just something fascinating about getting to know what’s under the hood of other people’s businesses. It’s like gossip, but about software.

## [OpsLevel raises $5M to fix DevOps](https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/opslevel-raises-5m-to-fix-devops/)

The term “DevOps” has been rendered meaningless and developers still don’t have access to the right tools to put the overall idea into practice, the team behind DevOps startup OpsLevel argues. The company, which was co-founded by John Laban and Kenneth Rose, two of PagerDuty’s earliest employees, today announced that it has raised a $5 million seed funding round, led by Vertex Ventures. S28 Capital, Webb Investment Network and Union Capital also participated in this round, as well as a number of angels, including the three co-founders of PagerDuty .

## [Getting GitOps right](https://platform.sh/blog/2020/getting-gitops-right/)

The Git version control system is 15 years old and has by all accounts taken over the development world. It’s unusual and weird to find a serious software project that isn’t using Git today (though a few holdouts still have lots of auxiliary tools built around Subversion they haven’t managed to jettison yet). The great thing about Git, though, is that it’s capable of so much more than just a place to dump source code.

## [The golden age of configuration languages](https://cosminilie.ro/posts/evolution-of-configuration-languages/)

I think DevOps, as we understand it today, is coming to an end. At least the Ops part of it. As cloud infrastructure becomes a key application concern, more and more ops tasks are done by the cloud itself or built into the application. What’s left is the provisioning and management of the infrastructure needed by the application. This comes with all the baggage associated, like security and networking, for example.

## [Making GitHub CI workflow 3x faster](https://github.blog/2020-10-29-making-github-ci-workflow-3x-faster/)

Welcome to the first deep dive of the Building GitHub blog series, providing a look at how teams across the GitHub engineering organization identify and address opportunities to improve our internal development tooling and infrastructure.

## [K0s – Zero Friction Kubernetes](https://github.com/k0sproject/k0s)

k0s is an all-inclusive Kubernetes distribution with all the required bells and whistles preconfigured to make building a Kubernetes clusters a matter of just copying an executable to every host and running it.

## [Transitioning from Docker to Podman](https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/11/19/transitioning-from-docker-to-podman/)

Podman is an excellent alternative to Docker containers when you need increased security, unique identifier (UID) separation using namespaces, and integration with systemd. In this article, I use real-world examples to show you how to install Podman, use its basic commands, and transition from the Docker command-line interface (CLI) to Podman. You’ll also see how to run an existing image with Podman and how to set up port forwarding.

## [Kubernetes Monitoring and Logging — An Apache Spark Example](https://towardsdatascience.com/kubernetes-monitoring-and-logging-an-apache-spark-example-62e3c8b1224b?source=rss----7f60cf5620c9---4)

However, when I set up the environment at the beginning, I found it is a little difficult to understand what is actually going there. I realized I need an end-to-end monitoring setup for my Kubernetes cluster and its applications. In this blog, I will use Apache Spark on Kubernetes as an example to share what I use as my monitoring and logging stack. I want to give an overview here, I will have another blog to explain the how-to in details.

## [Getting Started with Ansible](https://steampunk.si/blog/getting-started-with-ansible/)

We will start by introducing Ansible and some of the benefits we gain when using it. Next, we will describe the differences between three different Ansible packages and give some advice on picking the right one for our use case. We will continue with the installation instructions and finally wrap up with an interactive walkthrough of Ansible’s basic functionality like running Ansible playbooks and installing extra Ansible content.
