## [The Future of Kubernetes](https://www.eficode.com/blog/the-future-of-kubernetes-and-why-developers-should-look-beyond-kubernetes-in-2022)

  

Kubernetes has been the primary container orchestration tool for a while, and it'll continue to be for quite some time. But developers should explore other paradigms. For instance, Kubernetes came about because of Docker containers, which have been around since Linux variants. Furthermore, Kubernetes is popular because it was built on top of Docker containers, and after Docker's focus on developer experience made them popular, they took off. One more reason for Kubernetes' popularity is that it did not change things--namely, when it came into play, how nodes are scheduled within clusters (aka orchestrated).

  

## [Building Password Purgatory with Cloudflare Pages and Workers](https://www.troyhunt.com/building-password-purgatory-with-cloudflare-pages-and-workers/)

Somewhere in my Microsoft 365 spam filter, an email found its way and consumed some time. I've been planning the best revenge tactics for when this happens again. First, the spammers have to be punished! One of those methods is a place or state where they will suffer named "Password Purgatory." Do you know how we despise password complexity criteria? That's what I'm now referring to as Password Purgatory - that temporary state of misery - and you're going to do it too. All the Michelle's need to do first is create their passwords. They'll end up on the troy hunt website after all. This idea was clever, no?

  

## [Deploy Portainer for Easier Container Management](https://thenewstack.io/deploy-portainer-for-easier-container-management/)

One way to make container management efficient is by utilizing a GUI tool that provides access from anywhere on your LAN. Portainer is especially helpful for managing containers with many moving parts, such as scaling up deployments. Portainer makes this process more manageable, and it functions smoothly on Kubernetes or Docker-based platforms like Docker Swarm. So for anyone looking for a GUI application to manage containers effectively and reliably - we recommend Portainer!

  

  

## [Software Supply Chain Security: Tearing Down the Silos](https://thenewstack.io/software-supply-chain-security-tearing-down-the-silos/)

The nature of Kubernetes, which allows you to scale, distribute and share applications, can also create many weak points in containerized environments. There are attack vectors like open-source code developers use to build applications code with hidden vulnerabilities. Furthermore, there are numerous interconnected containers with multiple dependencies and microservices that security teams must monitor. The version control repository for GitOps (GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket), the entire CI/CD pipeline and cloud infrastructure, as well as K8S clusters themselves, are all on the security team's watch list.

  

## [As cloud costs spiral upward, enterprises turn to a thing called FinOps](https://www.zdnet.com/article/as-cloud-costs-spiral-upward-enterprises-turn-to-a-thing-called-finops/)

  

Despite the cost savings it offered for the first few years of cloud computing, now businesses are faced with spiraling costs. There's even a word for this- "FinOps." Organizations continue to waste significant amounts of money on their cloud usage. Flexera's recently released 2022 State Of The Cloud Report estimates that 32% of spending goes inefficiently down the drain because many organizations underestimate how much they waste when utilizing public clouds.

## [Running a Redis cluster on AWS with Terraform as IaC and Github Actions As CI/CD](https://medium.com/@sanilkhurana7/running-a-redis-cluster-on-aws-with-terraform-as-iac-and-github-actions-as-ci-cd-a806ce6c447d?source=rss------software_development-5)

I attempt to create a production-level Redis cluster with CI/CD in this post. To do that, I use Github actions and infrastructure-as-code with Terraform. Deploying it on AWS is also possible using Docker compose for container orchestration and Docker swarm mode for deployment orchestration. There are some improvements we can make in the future, but there's a good amount of ground covered here.

  

## [Why do developers find Kubernetes so hard?](https://itnext.io/why-do-developers-find-kubernetes-hard-6532e8d6ce7f)

Modern DevOps practices encourage you to 'shift left' and embrace the idea that you build it and run it. As boundaries between silos become blurred, developers must learn and know more than ever before. Development teams became multi-disciplinary 'mini-companies' that can be scaled to moderate size. How can we reconcile developers taking ownership for what they create with operations, security, and compliance concerns still being proper?

  

  

## [Monorepos are changing how teams build software](https://vercel.com/blog/monorepos-are-changing-how-teams-build-software)

The largest software companies in the world use monorepos. But historically, software development teams of all sizes have found it challenging to adopt monorepos until Turborepo came out. Turborepo takes the lessons and workflows from Facebook and Google and makes them open for everyone.

  

## [Why Kubernetes is important for the future of data platforms](https://mertkavi.com/why-kubernetes-is-important-for-the-future-of-data-platforms/)

As the amount of data goes up, so do the problems that need solving. Information technology requires us to provide robust and reliable database management solutions and scalable machine learning in the coming decades more than it has in past years.

  

## [Why Single Sign on Sucks](https://goteleport.com/blog/why-sso-sucks/)

  

I only need to enter my credentials one time! It would be great to just log into my computer and go about my work without seeing login forms or redirect dances. The problem is that each app has a different architecture, so standardization is near impossible. One solution addresses these concerns by integrating identity providers such as Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) or Ping Identity's Single Sign-On products via SAML or OAuth2.

  

  

## [10 best practices to secure your AWS environment](https://www.balubor.com/10-best-practices-to-secure-your-aws-environment)

You registered on the AWS. You are eager to start using it. And you want to solve the problem that drove you to Amazon Web Services in the first place, but there's a catch! When starting off with an environment of cloud computing, security is addressed first and foremost. You need protection for your AWS resources from any possible attack, especially your accounts, which hold personal information about yourself or your company, as such passwords and keys, among other things, could be revealed by hackers if not appropriately safeguarded.

  

## [Kubernetes has crossed the chasm. Will GitOps follow?](https://www.weave.works/blog/kubernetes-crossed-chasm-will-gitops-follow)

The data shows that Kubernetes has gone from a niche technology to go mainstream in organizations worldwide. Furthermore, it is becoming more common and an underlying architecture for many technologies. Across the entire universe of respondents, 93% of organizations have more than one production cluster running, and almost two-thirds â€“ 64% - have five or more clusters running simultaneously. An additional 67% of those surveyed said they had between 20-50 clusters at any given time! As a result, a staggering 5 million developers are using today's Kubernetes release.

  

## [Kubernetes Is a High-Value Cyberwar Target](https://thenewstack.io/kubernetes-is-a-high-value-cyberwar-target/)

Modern military conflicts are not limited to the air, ground, and sea domains. They also cover cyberspace. There is some evidence that cyber operations have already begun in a conflict. In this article, we will explore how modern technologies like Kubernetes could be affected by such a conflict, primarily CNA activities that involve disrupting, denying, or destroying critical infrastructure and economic and technology targets to make an adversary's war effort more difficult.

  

  

## [Extract greater efficiency from your CI pipelines](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2022/03/09/efficient-pipelines/)

Here, I will walk you through the process of finding a sweet spot in GitLab CI optimization. The principles that I'll cover work well for existing pipelines and new ones. Please note that this is subjective, and the sweet spot might be very different depending on a user's scenario or situation.

  

## [Docker vs. Kubernetes](https://faun.pub/docker-vs-kubernetes-37a2da0648fc)

  

Docker helps "create" containers, and Kubernetes allows you to "manage" them at runtime. Use Docker for packaging and shipping the app. Use Kubernetes for deploying and scaling your app as your company grows.

Linkerd is taking the lead in service mesh adoption, with a recent CNCF survey showing increased adoption in North America, Europe, and Asia. Independent of the survey, analyst firm Enterprise Management Associates (EMA) noted Linkerd's "strong momentum." "Its growing user base is raving about its simplicity and targeted addition of more enterprise-grade features."

  

## [Would You Run This Docker Image?](https://towardsdatascience.com/would-you-run-this-docker-image-7b52d99e78ec)

Docker Hub is a service that provides access to containers, but how do you know the image you pulled from there is safe to use? How can we analyze a vision for security vulnerabilities before moving into production? I'll show you how by analyzing an example container in this story. This crucial step will ensure your Docker images are secure and ready for production. But even if they are intended just as one run locally on your machine, it's important not to skip this step!

  

## [HCP Packer Is Now Generally Available](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/hcp-packer-is-now-generally-available)

  

At HashiConf in October, we announced the public beta of our HCP Packer service. Today, we're pleased to announce that it is now generally available for organizations. The HCP Packer configuration and management improves workflows and is a standardized way to secure images among an organization.

This article will tell you how to use EC2 Spot Instances with EKS. You'll understand 4 pricing models and when to use Spot Instances, as well as how they work and how to maximize investment and minimize drawbacks.

  

## [Infrastructure is Distribution](https://canvatechblog.com/infrastructure-is-distribution-9b2bbef57553)

Planet-scale distribution is not a solved problem. There are many ways to get your products into the hands of users. For example, eBay or Yahoo could get their products in front of millions of users without building their own physical distribution networks. The Internet made for a cheap and readily-accessible platform where customers could come at any time of the day; then came the rise of Cloud computing. Most small businesses don't need Infrastructure engineers to solve this problem because providers like Cloud providers and PaaS providers have product offerings allowing small businesses to get their products in front.
