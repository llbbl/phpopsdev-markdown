## [When DevOps Dominoes Come Crashing Down | by Janislav Jankov | CtrlStack](https://blog.ctrlstack.com/when-devops-dominoes-come-crashing-down-7b6467e49401)

According to a recent survey, internal changes are the root cause of most outages and performance degradation. To answer each "why," we look at what has changed that could contribute to the observed behavior, working backward one step at a time. However, finding changes in the system is a slow and manual process that spans multiple systems of record and relies on (strongly) expert knowledge of the application architecture and previous behavior.

  

## [Throughput vs Latency. Low latency and high throughput are… | by Sam Malayek | Level Up Coding](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/throughput-vs-latency-1b4f5b38c3d)

Latency is the time it takes for an action to produce its intended effect in any given system. In computer networking, latency is typically measured in milliseconds. Throughput is the amount of data that is transferred per second. High throughput can be achieved by building a pipe wide enough with as few bottlenecks as possible. If the required latency is seconds to minutes or more, a distributed filesystem like AWS S3 provides a very simple but effective intermediary stateful resource for processing data between machines.
