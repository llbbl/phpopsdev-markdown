## [Give Up GitHub](https://sfconservancy.org/GiveUpGitHub/)

We're calling on all FOSS developers to give up on GitHub and move to better alternatives. We realize this is not an easy task. Still, there are many reasons to leave GitHub, including that they are a for-profit company that uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) to generate code interactively for developers. In addition, they have a contract with the USA Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and they do not offer any self-hosting FOSS option.

  

## [Coder Speeds Build Time with Multicloud Platform](https://thenewstack.io/coder-speeds-build-time-with-multicloud-platform/)

Coder is a multicloud, multicompute IDE platform designed for development shops that want to provide developers with more tooling options while still supporting uniform provisioning on demand. It is built on common development interfaces (SSH). In addition, it leverages open source Terraform on the back end to handle the provisioning, allowing developers to run a cloud IDE on any compute platform — including on-premise data centers, AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, DigitalOcean, Kubernetes, and Docker.

  

## [System Design Concepts: Dynamo, 16 Sheets of Paper That Changed the World](https://betterprogramming.pub/system-design-concepts-dynamo-16-sheets-of-paper-that-changed-the-world-fd2cba6585e3)

Amazon built an in-house database called Dynamo to solve its scalability issues with relational databases. This paper became popular and catalyzed the development of NoSQL databases. Dynamo was able to handle massive amounts of scale. It was the inspiration for many of the most popular databases today, such as AWS's SimpleDB, DynamoDB, and Cassandra. Dynamo describes a distributed database system built off multiple nodes that can run in complete isolation from one another. The data is distributed and replicated among the nodes. 

  

## [Opta vs. Pulumi](https://faun.pub/opta-vs-pulumi-39287fc130fd)

As a DevOps engineer, choosing the right tools for building your infrastructure is essential. Infrastructure as code removes the manual process of setting up infrastructure to support and scale your projects. Opta is a new kid on the IaC block offering high-level abstraction and functionality. Pulumi is a less rigid tool that focuses on cloud functionality.

-Schedule the workflow to run automatically every day.

  

## [How Bolt Scaled Remote Work with Tailscale's Zero Trust Mesh VPN](https://thenewstack.io/how-bolt-scaled-remote-work-with-tailscales-zero-trust-mesh-vpn/)

  

Bolt had trouble scaling its remote work VPN solution and switched to Tailscale. Tailscale is a zero-trust mesh VPN that is much more scalable and easier to use than traditional VPNs. Bolt's team could transition to Tailscale easily and found that it worked well with their existing workflow and software-as-a-service tools.

  

## [Open source body quits GitHub, urges you to do the same](https://www.theregister.com/2022/06/30/software_freedom_conservancy_quits_github/)

Software Freedom Conservancy, a non-profit focused on free and open-source software, has stopped using Microsoft's GitHub for project hosting. The break with GitHub was precipitated by the general availability of GitHub Copilot, an AI coding assistant tool. As a result, the SFC has added a Give Up on GitHub section to its website and is asking FOSS developers to voluntarily switch to a different code hosting service. GitHub's decision to release a for-profit product derived from FOSS code, the SFC said, is "too much to bear."

Deno software engineer Luca Casonato worked on Fresh, a new full-stack web framework for Deno. He took a break to share some details. 

"Fresh is a new style of web framework that's written for Dino rather than NodeJS," Casonato said. "It's really optimized for edge computing."

The majority of the rendering is done on the server, so the client "is only responsible for re-rendering small islands of interactivity," the announcement stated.
