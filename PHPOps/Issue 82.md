## [Deepfence Monitors Cloud-Native Applications in Production](https://thenewstack.io/deepfence-monitors-cloud-native-applications-in-production/)

Cloud-native security offerings have exploded recently, with solutions aimed at keeping networks, data, and applications secure. The "shift-left" movement has put several tools into developers' hands to ensure that applications are built as securely as possible. Deepfence deep packet inspection (DPI) scanning tool, ThreatMapper, is designed to examine an application at particular points in time and generate a software bill of materials (SBOM). At KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe in May, the company announced a cloud-native security solution.

  

## [Git explanation and commands for newbies](https://blog.devgenius.io/git-explanation-and-commands-for-newbies-75e97c8f1fd8)

## [Taking on Good Technical Debt](https://matt-rickard.com/good-technical-debt/)

Technical debt is bad, but it doesn't have to be the Godfather's offer. You can't refuse debt. Having good technical debt can create codebases that grow faster and healthier when done correctly. The correct type of technical debt often depends on a company's stage, risk profile, and industry. Choose technology appropriate for your scale, use commodity technology when possible, and start a project with a monorepo (see U-shaped Utility of Monorepos). Choose technology that can naturally evolve into more complex systems.

  

## [Portainer: How to add a Kubernetes Environment](https://thenewstack.io/portainer-how-to-add-a-kubernetes-environment/)

Portainer, a container management system, allows you to add multiple environments to Portainer. With this environment added, you can then manage your Kubernetes, making it possible to manage: namespaces, applications, secrets, secrets, and clusters. The method I'm going to walk you through is on Ubuntu Server 22.04, from start to finish. We will need both the kublectl command and Minikube installed, and Minix installed.

## [Kubernetes GraphQL Query in Go](https://betterprogramming.pub/kubernetes-graphql-query-in-go-2f88af8f0d67)

The article discusses why the author decided to use GraphQL over REST when developing a platform that would be used by many developers unfamiliar with command-line operations or kubectl. GraphQL is more flexible and extensible and thus easier for developers to use. The article then goes on to discuss how to implement GraphQL in Go.

  

## [REST vs GraphQL vs gRPC](https://blog.bitsrc.io/rest-vs-graphql-vs-grpc-684edfacf810)

REST, GraphQL, and gRPC are all popular API development technologies, but each has unique features that make it better suited for certain projects. There is no one-size-fits-all solution, so choose the one that best fits your needs.

  

## [GitOps - The Path to A Fully-Automated CI/CD Pipelines](https://www.weave.works/blog/gitops-fully-automated-ci-cd-pipelines)

Automating software delivery is a critical priority for any organization that follows the DevOps paradigm. Successful implementation of a CI/CD pipeline largely hinges on automating several labor-intensive manual tasks. GitOps is the latest turn in the evolution of configuration management and standardizes the principles for continuous deployment for cloud-native applications with Git as a single source of truth. Each stage has its comprehensive processes and tools to help automate them. We offer a solution in the form of GitOps.

  

## [Easy Kubernetes Deployments](https://blog.7linternational.com/easy-kubernetes-deployments-9c9888edacde)

In this tutorial, we learned how to deploy a Go gRPC service in a Kubernetes cluster, exposed via nginx ingress, and using Waypoint by HashiCorp to build and deploy the container and configure the ingress controller to serve our gRPC endpoints.

  

## [Introducing Zelos: A ZooKeeper API leveraging Delos](https://engineering.fb.com/2022/06/08/developer-tools/zelos/)

Meta's Zelos is a new version of Apache ZooKeeper on the Delos platform. Zelos will eventually replace all ZooKeper clusters in Meta's fleet. Delos abstracts application logic into a finite state machine replicated across nodes in the system, often called replicas. The replicas of the ensemble then learn these state machine updates in order and apply the updates to their local storage. Zelos provides the abstraction of state machine replication engines or SMREngines. Each proposal is propagated down the stack before it reaches the engine's logic.

  

## [The End of Localhost](https://dx.tips/the-end-of-localhost)

Dev environments should be cattle, not pets, writes Hacker News and Twitter. It looks likely that in the future, most development will not be done on localhost, the most precious pet of all. Make the ultimate developer experience wishlist for the average rich-country developer in 2030: fast gigabit internet is cheap and everywhere (5G or mesh wifi). Dev machines (laptops, tablets, VR) are cheap and have multi-day battery life. Your apps build in a second regardless of scale, with tests and staging environments/deploy previews instantly live after every keystroke. Your dev environment travels with you no matter which device you use.

  

## [The Kubernetes API architecture](https://medium.com/@danielepolencic/the-Kubernetes-API-architecture-81da0ede0e34)

The Kubernetes API server is a web server that authenticates, authorizes, and audits requests to the Kubernetes cluster. The API server is also extensible, so you can add your APIs and register them with Kubernetes.

## [One developer's journey bringing Dependabot to GitHub Enterprise Server](https://github.blog/2022-06-07-one-developers-journey-bringing-dependabot-to-github-enterprise-server/)

Last week, Dependabot was generally available on GitHub Enterprise Server (GHES). Developers using GHES can now secure their dependencies and keep them up-to-date. A single vulnerability would eat up days of engineering time for a team maintaining 14 Ruby apps in our microservices-based architecture, so we needed to repeat the process for each app. In addition, the team was still running Ruby's 3.2, which was no longer maintained when Rails 6 was released six years later. We had to apply our security patches to our codebase instead of getting them from the framework.

Trivy is a security scanner that is fast, easy to set up, and can be used on a wide range of target platforms. Trivy helps scan for security vulnerabilities in multiple platforms and suggests recommendations to resolve them.

  

## [MongoDB Releases Queryable Encryption Preview](https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/mongodb-releases-queryable-encryption-preview)

MongoDB has released a preview of Queryable Encryption, allowing customers to encrypt sensitive data and run expressive queries on the encrypted data. With this release, MongoDB is the only database provider that allows customers to run rich query expressions like range, equality, prefix, suffix, and more on encrypted data. This is a huge advantage for customers as they can confidently run expressive queries while securing their data.

  

## [The State of K8s Software Supply Chain Attacks](https://containerjournal.com/features/the-state-of-k8s-software-supply-chain-attacks/)

Software supply chain attacks grew by more than 300% from 2020 to 2021. Security researchers have noticed a change in focus from Docker to Kubernetes-based attacks. Attackers have also been found to run rootkits, which can be leveraged to hide other nefarious behaviors. The report found that 50% of container image incidents had worms in 2021, enabling hackers to automatically seek vulnerable systems and infect them, significantly increasing the potential attack surface. 19% of malicious container images analyzed targeted containers and API servers.

## [Why We're Sticking with Ruby on Rails at Gitlab](https://thenewstack.io/why-were-sticking-with-ruby-on-rails-at-gitlab/)

When David Heinemeier Hansson created Ruby on Ruby on Rails, he was guided by his experience with both PHP and Java. We used to make a similar and similarly challenging distinction between server-class operating systems such as Windows and macOS that were approachable but crashed significantly. But approachability and messiness are not linked except by historical accident, and the same turns out to be true for approachability. Modularity has generally been elusive as it is the most sought with the default architecture of most systems.

  

  

## [The Architecture of a Kubernetes Cluster](https://www.mirantis.com/blog/the-architecture-of-a-kubernetes-cluster)

This week, we explore the architecture of a Kubernetes cluster in this series of lessons. The lessons assume a basic familiarity with the Linux command line and a Unix-like operating system. In this series, we'll break down core cloud-native concepts, challenges, and best practices into short, manageable exercises and explainers so you can learn five minutes at a time. We'll explore the core components of a cluster, how they interact with one another, and how we interact with them.
