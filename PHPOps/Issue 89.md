## [You Don't Need Microservices](https://itnext.io/you-dont-need-microservices-2ad8508b9e27)

Microservices are expensive, difficult to maintain, and not always necessary. However, you can achieve many of the benefits of microservices by simply increasing the size or number of boxes available across the board, routing traffic to independently scalable clusters of your app instance, or separating asynchronous tasks into background jobs with independently scalable queues.

  

  

## [Goodbye Sealed Secrets, hello SOPS](https://itnext.io/goodbye-sealed-secrets-hello-sops-3ee6a92662bb)

Sops is a binary that encrypts configuration files. It understands format (JSON, YAML, INI, etc.) and will only encrypt the values of each line (in a key/value pair).

  

Sops provides the following advantages:

  

-The private and public keys created by Age are stored inside the file key.txt. We moved this file inside a .sops directory inside the home folder.

  

-To tell Sops where everything is, add these ENV variables to your shell configuration (/.bashrc or /.zshrc)

## [Basics of Load Balancing](https://blog.devgenius.io/basics-of-load-balancing-f8a1abd97ece)

Load balancing is routing client requests to the best available server at a given time for the best utilization of available resources. This is done abstractly to clients, so they are unaware of the number of servers in the backend. Load balancing can be implemented by adding more machines and installing the service on them, then routing requests through a proxy. This strategy makes the system more reliable and resilient to handle high loads.

## [Git from Scratch: Basic Git Terminologies](https://medium.com/@senevirathnehu/git-from-scratch-basic-git-terminologies-2b8c663ea592)

A Git repository is a database that stores information about revisions and the history of a project. A local repository is stored on your computer, while a remote repository is stored on the internet. A branch represents an independent line of development. A commit represents a change made to the repository. The index is a temporary file that describes the repository's directory structure. Cherry-picking is used to apply a commit from one branch to another. Stashing allows you to switch branches without committing the current branch. A fork is a copy of a repository. Finally, a pull request is a way for a developer to tell.

## [How to Remove Sensitive Data and Plaintext Secrets From GitHub](https://www.secjuice.com/github-complete-cleaning-sensitive-secrets/)

To clean your GitHub commit history of sensitive data, you must first remove all the secrets from each repository, then use BFG Repo-Cleaner to clean the commits. However, BFG Repo-Cleaner will only clean the checked-out git branch, so you must repeat the process for every branch. Additionally, since GitHub PRs are independent of the git repository, you must manually remove all the PRs and their commits. Finally, to help prevent sensitive data from being committed in the future, you can use a git pre-commit hook.
