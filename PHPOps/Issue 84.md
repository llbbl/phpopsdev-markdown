## [Blind SQL Injection — Threat or Child's Play?](https://arctype.com/blog/blind-sql-injection-threat-play/)

Blind SQL injection is a type of SQL injection where an attacker cannot figure out how our web applications "think," so instead, they have to rely on the output a web application gives us or rely on time, depending on which method (boolean-based or time-based) is in use. When relying on boolean-based SQL injection, an attacker counts on the fact that the web application might look different than usual, while when using time-based SQL injection, an attacker sends a query that forces the database to wait a couple of seconds before returning a response.
