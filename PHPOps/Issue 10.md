## [Amazon ECS vs. Amazon EKS: The Ultimate Showdown](https://thenewstack.io/amazon-ecs-vs-amazon-eks-the-ultimate-showdown/)

Cloud providers offer a broad set of products to enable scalability while moving faster and minimizing costs. As the cloud infrastructure sector leader, AWS comprises more than 175 services and products in a broad range of computing, networking, database, storage and security.

## [Creating Kubernetes Cluster On Amazon EKS](https://quileswest.medium.com/creating-kubernetes-cluster-on-amazon-eks-a63c30a755c8)

In this lab we’ll run through the process of creating a Kubernetes Cluster using Amazon EKS.

## [Why Many Engineers Don’t Understand the Real Use of Serverless](https://medium.com/better-programming/why-many-engineers-dont-understand-the-real-use-of-serverless-df2300766aa9)

The primary argument mentioned in the somewhat controversial YouTube video is speed. To put it more concretely, the major drawback of serverless applications from the author’s standpoint is the (well-known) cold start problem — the added latency where your code potentially cannot start execution until the underlying cloud service finishes allocating compute resources, pulling the code or container image, installing extra packages, and configuring the environment.

## [Why outsource your auth system?](https://fusionauth.io/blog/2021/01/20/why-outsource-auth/)

Authentication is one of those components that you deal with all the time. Auth is a necessary part of any software product, but how you implement auth is not necessarily always the same. Careful consideration is needed, because your decision to outsource will not only impact speed of development, but also long-term product maintenance – you don’t want to slow down time to market because you re-implemented an entire auth system unnecessarily, but you also don’t want to use an auth system that is going to cause problems down the road.

## [Helio: a supercomputer at your fingertips](https://medium.com/first-momentum-ventures/helio-a-supercomputer-at-your-fingertips-43adff40dabe)

Helio is building an API-driven computing platform for large-scale workloads, addressing a huge and vastly overlooked opportunity:

## [A quick approach for cost monitoring on Kubernetes](https://larribas.me/posts/monitoring-kubernetes-costs-with-no-extra-tools/)

This article presents an approach to approximate the costs a specific project/team generates on Kubernetes, based on the ratio of resources allocated to them vs. the total resources in the cluster.

## [Amazon: Not OK – Why we had to change Elastic licensing](https://www.elastic.co/blog/why-license-change-AWS)

So why the change? AWS and Amazon Elasticsearch Service. They have been doing things that we think are just NOT OK since 2015 and it has only gotten worse. If we don’t stand up to them now, as a successful company and leader in the market, who will?

## [DevOps in Game Development](https://medium.com/another-angle/devops-in-game-development-c89a9bf21787)

When it comes to developing a large project in a small, newly established studio it is crucial to focus only on the tasks that are essential. I want to share some thoughts on what can be helpful during development — no matter if you are a solo developer or working with a team. Will this apply to larger studios? Perhaps some aspects will but have in mind that this text is written from a small studio developer’s perspective. Larger companies have their own, more advanced solutions.

## [The database servers powering Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/2021/01/21/next-gen-database-servers.html)

Let’s Encrypt helps to protect a huge portion of the Web by providing TLS certificates to more than 235 million websites. A database is at the heart of how Let’s Encrypt manages certificate issuance. If this database isn’t performing well enough, it can cause API errors and timeouts for our subscribers. Database performance is the single most critical factor in our ability to scale while meeting service level objectives. In late 2020, we upgraded our database servers and we’ve been very happy with the results.

## [Fulfilling the Promise of CI/CD](https://stackoverflow.blog/2021/01/19/fulfilling-the-promise-of-ci-cd/)

When people say “CI/CD,” they are only talking about continuous integration. Nobody is talking about (or practicing) continuous deployment. AT ALL. It’s like we have all forgotten it exists. It's time to change that.

## [Take the first step toward SRE with Cloud Operations Sandbox](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/operations/on-the-road-to-sre-with-cloud-operations-sandbox/)

At Google Cloud, we strive to bring Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) culture to our customers not only through training on organizational best practices, but also with the tools you need to run successful cloud services. Part and parcel of that is comprehensive observability tooling—logging, monitoring, tracing, profiling and debugging—which can help you troubleshoot production issues faster, increase release velocity and improve service reliability.
