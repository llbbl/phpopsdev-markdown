Microsoft Excel has become a full-fledged programming language thanks to LAMBDA's new feature. Microsoft Excel may be the oldest consumer software used widely since its debut over 34 years ago. In addition, open-source solutions like database Postgres and eBPF offered new ways to operate and accelerate the delivery cycle. As we look to what’s next, the fascinating technology of Web3, a decentralized version of the internet that is based on blockchain, is already on the horizon, challenging how we build and manage the following technology stack.

  

## [22 predictions about the Software Development trends in 2022](https://towardsdatascience.com/22-predictions-about-the-software-development-trends-in-2022-fcc82c263788)

The public Cloud is now the hotbed of digital innovation, and the trend will continue in 2022. Gartner has predicted a 16% revenue increase of public Cloud in the coming years. Public Cloud plays a significant role in democratizing Security, Blockchain and bringing innovations in an accessible way to the customer. Edge computing brings storage, compute power, and AI/ML near the customer, with low latency, poor network bandwidth, and real-time use cases. Kubernetes will go background, while Docker will bounce back.

## [2022 Forecast: What’s Next for Tech Workers?](https://thenewstack.io/2022-forecast-whats-next-for-tech-workers/)

The tech job landscape remains a seller’s market, with the impact of The Great Resignation still being felt. Workers in all fields are flexing their negotiating power, and tech workers, already in high demand, are demanding more money and better conditions. Technology that enables remote work — distributed networks, video streaming — will require support and innovation. In 2022, organizations will need to get creative instead of throwing money at job candidates, recruiter Taylor Desseyn says.

## [What’s next for Cloud Foundry](https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/27/whats-next-for-cloud-foundry/)

Craig McLuckie, the co-founder of the Kubernetes project, was named the chairman of the Cloud Foundry Foundation. He is the VP of R&D at Heptio, who sold his startup to the company, to be the new chairman of board of directors of the foundation. He succeeds Paul Fazzone, who was named chairman in April 2020, as the CNCF’s executive director. The foundation is looking to focus on three things: support the contributor community, whether they provide better support for end-users who consume the open source.

  

## [The State of Sustainable Architecture Practices in 2022](https://thenewstack.io/the-state-of-sustainable-architecture-practices-in-2022/)

Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform account for more than half of the international data center market. Cloud providers going green isn’t about being altruistic. Carbon-neutral cloud computing is all about business sustainability and protection from regulation. By being greener, you are inherently being more risk-averse. The New Stack looks at the next logical steps including sustainable architecture, carbon-aware tooling and the massive stake cloud providers have in making or breaking this last-ditch effort to literally save the world.

  

## [CDK: Once more unto the breach](https://itnext.io/cdk-once-more-unto-the-breach-f2673cf219a6)

Some Cloud Engineers prefer Terraform for its modules, agnosticism, and state management. Others prefer AWS’s CDK for its wild abstractions, support in “normal” programming concepts (looping anyone??) and languages like TypeScript and Python. Some of us prefer CloudFormation — because it works and we know it. But that doesn’t mean we should stay in our comfort zones — growth only occurs when you are uncomfortable. The biggest pull for moving to CDK was its ability to do the work for me — I wanted the ability to use more of someone else else.

  

## [On-premise to cloud migration mock drills using Istio](https://faun.pub/on-premise-to-cloud-migration-mock-drills-using-istio-ea89aee5ea38?source=rss----10d1a7495d39---4)

Part 1 of a series of articles about cloud migration in Istio. We have 50+ Microservices running on Kubernetes infrastructure in on-premise and we have to migrate this entire platform to AWS EKS cluster. The migration project can be quite simple or rather complex depending on factors such as the migration scope and maturity of the workloads being moved. In this article I am going to talk about large enterprise migration where we have. 50+ microservice running on Kubernetes infrastructure onpremise.

  

  

## [Feature Flags with Next.js and GrowthBook](https://dev.to/jdorn/feature-flags-with-nextjs-and-growthbook-4ide)

Feature Flags decouple deployment and release with feature flags. Deploying code to production is scary and stressful. Using feature flags, you are able to instantly update which version of the code users see without a deploy. By using feature flags you just decreased your downtime from 5+ minutes to mere seconds and limited the impact to a small percent of your traffic. Plus, you decreased the stress levels of you and your teammates 100 fold, which is always a good thing. In this tutorial, I'll be using a standard Next.js app and GrowthBook as the feature flagging platform.

  

  

## [10 day-to-day Git Commands for Developer](https://blog.devgenius.io/10-day-to-day-git-commands-for-developer-f6d4598baa1d)

Git is the most commonly used version control system across the Globe in the software industry. It provides a medium to track and control over changes made in the source code. Mastering Git could take time as there are various commands covering different scenarios. Let’s today, start learning with the fundamental commands which are quite handy in the day-to-day development project(s) The commands include git init, git clone, git checkout, git add, git commit, git stash and git status.

## [Top 5 Docker Myths and Facts That You Should be Aware of](https://collabnix.com/top-5-docker-myths-and-facts-that-you-should-be-aware-of/)

Docker is still the #1 most wanted and #2 most loved developer tools, and helps millions of developers build, share and run any app, anywhere – on-prem or in the cloud. Docker simplifies and accelerates your workflow, while giving developers the freedom to innovate with their choice of tools, application stacks, and deployment environments for each project. With over 396 billion all-time DockerHub pulls, 16.2 million Docker Desktop downloads & 9 million Docker desktop downloads, Docker is the most popular container platform among developers.

  

## [How to Automate Dataset Comparison Using Terraform And BigQuery](https://raescoto.medium.com/how-i-automated-my-job-using-terraform-and-bigquery-b25adec5af63)

How to Automate Dataset Comparison Using Terraform And BigQuery using Terraform and BigQuery. BigQuery allows us to query CSVs that are stored on Google Cloud Storage. For each dataset, find if the new dataset is missing any data automating the creation of the environment and services required to accomplish this. The test results were not successful, neither the real ones nor the fake ones I shred with the datasets (neither the. real ones. nor the. fake ones.

  

## [Restrict provisioning to certain resource types in Terraform](https://aws.plainenglish.io/restrict-provisioning-to-certain-resource-types-in-terraform-4262dd508c74)

When you use Terraform to provision your infrastructure, you can easily configure the resources as you want them to be. Sometimes, you as a team lead or project owner might want to restrict the type of EC2 instance your teams can provision. The best way to do that is by using Sentinel, I achieved this using a small hack. I used Terraform modules and created a module (parent module) for my team that controls the restrictions. This way the team can still make changes to the child module without having to go through me.

  

## [Container-to-Container Communication](https://www.miketheman.net/2021/12/28/container-to-container-communication/)

Question: Is there a material difference between communicating over local network TCP vs local Unix domain sockets? Given an application with more than a single container that need to talk to each other, is there an observable difference in latency/throughput when using one inter-component communication method over another from an end-users’ perspective? I wanted to use a common-ish scenario: a web service running on cloud infrastructure I don’t own. For the experiment, I chose this set of components: nginx (web server) – terminate SSL, proxy requests to upstream web server, and starlette (Python application framework) – handle request/response response.

  

## [An Introduction to AWS CloudFormation for Beginners](https://aws.plainenglish.io/aws-cloud-formation-54fe269c8874)

AWS CloudFormation is a coding-based approach to the provision and manages AWS resources as well as third-party resources. It is a YAML or JSLF file and all the resources and instructions about how to be provisioned will be written in a structured and predefined way in that file. We can use that template in many regions to create the same resource stack. We define the set of resources that we specified in CFT as a single unit called Stack when you create, delete, and update the resources in a CFT that will affect the Stack.

  

## [Dynamically Generating DB creds via Vault](https://irezyigit.medium.com/dynamically-generating-db-creds-for-via-vault-34e1f83ce647)

  

To setup our DB Engine in Vault we can follow the below setups. We need a DB and what better way to get up and running then with a container. We can ask for dynamic creds programmatically as well using Vault API via something like: //localhost:8200/v1/postgres14/creds/read-only or by cli as below. When we select Get Credentials and select the role we created from below we should be receiving our dynamic DB creds.

  

## [Autoscale Your Application For Unexpected Traffic Using Kubernetes](https://betterprogramming.pub/autoscale-your-application-for-unexpected-traffic-using-kubernetes-ff5ee7d9f22)

An application can be horizontally scalable to handle unexpected traffic from marketing campaigns like Black Friday or 11.11 while sleeping. How do we provide scalable API on production for unpredictable data size? At the end of this tutorial series, we will achieve a scalable design as followed:Containerized application code creates the building block for us to scale. The answer is Kubernetes, it is the most popular container orchestration platform which is basically the conductor of the container's concerts. The magic comes later.

  

## [Kubernetes Zero Trust Networking with Calico Network Policies](https://medium.com/@lambdaEranga/kubernetes-zero-trust-networking-with-calico-network-policies-95b3607e45d?source=rss------kubernetes-5)

In this post I’m gonna discuss about achieving Zero Trust Networking on Kubernetes using Calico CNI network policies. The CNI(Container Network Interface) consists of a specification and libraries for writing plugins to configure networking in Linux containers. Calico takes a holistic view of networking, concerning itself with network security and administration. The Calico plugin wraps around the Calico framework within the CNI framework. The plugins are supporting various functions like namespace isolation, traffic filtering, IP filtering, traffic mirroring, changing load balancing algorithms.

  

  

## [Node.js: Heroes of Worker Threads - C++ Addon](https://itnext.io/node-js-heroes-of-worker-threads-c-addon-76dd11f34c33)

Node.js has several ways to solve one of the biggest problems of JavaScript: CPU-bound tasks. The tools will be a “native” implementation of a particular module and a purely js version. The results will be based on the most popular, coolest, most advanced game: Heroes of Might and Magic III III. We will try a little bit more ― modules that are used on frontend, CPU+I/O-bound task etc. We’ll do this in 2 parts in Part I and Part II.

  

  

## [Creating S3 Upload Presigned URL with API Gateway and Lambda](https://blog.devgenius.io/creating-s3-upload-presigned-url-with-api-gateway-and-lambda-fd89c08bd1aa)

Let's create an S3 upload presigned URL generator using Lambda fronted by the API gateway. Lambda function is implemented using Golang using Terraform. The API gateway dispatch the request to the function, which in turn talks to the S3 bucket to get a pre-signed upload URL. The user then uploads his/her file to the bucket with the URL, this URL is returned to the user as the response of the API. Terraform is used to achieve the above architecture.
