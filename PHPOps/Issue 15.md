## [Google admits Kubernetes container tech is too complex](https://www.theregister.com/2021/02/25/google_kubernetes_autopilot/)

Google has recognized that users struggle to configure Kubernetes correctly and introduced a new Autopilot service in an attempt to simplify deployment and management.

## [Quickly Deploy Applications Using Terraform With Kubernetes on GCP](https://medium.com/google-cloud/quickly-deploy-applications-using-terraform-with-kubernetes-on-gcp-6a4d7d142839)

In previous article, we learnt how to deploy a Wordpress using Kubernetes. Even though in that article I have prepared some scripts to deploy and it is fast enough, there is another way to deploy much more faster. Yes, we can use Terraform. If you have experience on AWS, you may hear about CloudFormation. Terraform is similar to CloudFormation but it can be applied on different cloud providers. In this article, we will deploy two applications using Terraform step by step.

## [Modules, Monoliths, and Microservices](https://tailscale.com/blog/modules-monoliths-and-microservices/)

Lately, I get people asking me when microservices are a good idea. In systems design explains the world, I talked about big-picture issues like second system effect, innovator’s dilemmas, and more. Can systems design answer the microservices question?

## [Go & Kubernetes: Rapidly Developing Golang Microservices](https://blog.getambassador.io/go-kubernetes-rapidly-developing-golang-microservices-bfe36cfb5893)

Kubernetes is a container orchestration platform that enables its users to deploy and scale their microservice applications at any scale: from one service to thousands of services. Unleashing the power of Kubernetes is often more complicated than it may initially seem — the learning curve for application developers is particularly steep. Knowing what to do is just half the battle, then you have to choose the best tools to do the job. So how do Go developers create a development workflow on Kubernetes that is fast and effective?

## [A new era of Kubernetes integrations on GitLab.com](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2021/02/22/gitlab-kubernetes-agent-on-gitlab-com/)

The GitLab Kubernetes Agent provides a secure connection between a GitLab instance and a Kubernetes cluster, and allows pull-based deployments to receive alerts based on the network policies. We released the first version of the GitLab Kubernetes Agent ("the Agent") back in September on self-managed GitLab instances. We are happy to announce that the Agent is available on GitLab SaaS, GitLab.com, and has many more features coming soon.

## [Gaining operational insights with AIOps using Amazon DevOps Guru](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/devops/gaining-operational-insights-with-aiops-using-amazon-devops-guru/)

Amazon DevOps Guru offers a fully managed AIOps platform service that enables developers and operators to improve application availability and resolve operational issues faster. It minimizes manual effort by leveraging machine learning (ML) powered recommendations. Its ML models take advantage of AWS’s expertise in operating highly available applications for the world’s largest e-commerce business for over 20 years. DevOps Guru automatically detects operational issues, predicts impending resource exhaustion, details likely causes, and recommends remediation actions.

## [Introduction to Infrastructure Provisioning Using Terraform](https://medium.com/@urfielahi07/introduction-to-infrastructure-provisioning-using-terraform-41f48b0fecab)

IT industry, including organizations of almost every size, is adopting cloud-based services for maintaining its application workloads. One cannot deny the fact that there are lot of operational constraints regarding the underlying infrastructure which becomes a headache for the development teams. That is where IaC has stepped in and allowed you to operate using cloud-based services with greater independence from the associated constraints.

## [6 Tips for Creating Helm Charts in Kubernetes Applications](https://betterprogramming.pub/6-tips-for-creating-helm-charts-in-kubernetes-applications-452a37446f31)

Deploying applications with Kubernetes usually requires defining multiple resources (this highly depends on the application itself), such as the config maps, secret deployments, and service resources. Each of these resources needs to be created using the Kubernetes API server. Moreover, some resources need to be created in a specific order or need to wait for the success of the creation of other resources.

## [The Ultimate Guide to Machine Learning Frameworks](https://thenewstack.io/the-ultimate-guide-to-machine-learning-frameworks/)

We have seen an explosion in developer tools and platforms related to machine learning and artificial intelligence during the last few years. From cloud-based cognitive APIs to libraries to frameworks to pre-trained models, developers make many choices to infuse AI into their applications.

## [API’s from Dev to Production — Part 3](https://dev.to/newday-technology/api-s-from-dev-to-production-part-3-7dn)

Welcome to Part 3 of this blog series that will go from the most basic example of a .net 5 webapi in C#, and the journey from development to production with a shift-left mindset. We will use Azure, Docker, GitHub, GitHub Actions for CI/C-Deployment and Infrastructure as Code using Pulumi.

## [Best Practices to Stay Safe with GitHub](https://medium.com/faun/best-practices-to-stay-safe-with-github-7dd627314043)

Source control management is an essential part of every organization that develops software applications for commercial purposes. It is important for developers who want to store and keep track of their projects or open-source contributions in collaboration with other developers.

## [Jenkins and Spinnaker—A Great Pair](https://cd.foundation/uncategorized/2021/02/25/jenkins-and-spinnaker-a-great-pair/)

In the world of DevOps, Continuous Deployment (CD) and Continuous Integration (CI) are the two major terms that are most widely used together, even though they are very different.  
CI and CD together form a software delivery pipeline that starts with the commit of a change to source code and stops when an update has been fully rolled out to production.

## [Kubernetes Development Environments — A Comparison](https://loft.sh/blog/kubernetes-development-environments-comparison/)

Kubernetes has left the state when it was mostly an ops technology behind and now is also very relevant for many developers. As I wrote in my blog post about the Kubernetes workflow, the first step for every developer who starts to directly work with Kubernetes is to set up/get access to a Kubernetes development environment.
