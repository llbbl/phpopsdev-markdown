## [NSA and CISA: Here's how to improve your Kubernetes cluster security](https://www.zdnet.com/article/nsa-and-cisa-heres-how-to-improve-your-kubernetes-cluster-security/)

National Security Agency and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency have published updated guidance about harden Kubernetes for managing container applications. NSA and CISA do not list the changes in the updated direction, but the industry didn't meet the initial recommendations with universal approval. CISA says the update contains additional details and explanations based on feedback from the industry, including more detailed info on logging and threat detection and other clarifications. The agencies maintain that Kubernetes is commonly targeted for data theft, computational power theft, or denial of service.

  

## [A Guide To Application Logging](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/a-guide-to-application-logging-665b4f38e1a6)

The purpose of logging is to generate a trail of information that will help understand the route a user or information takes through your application. Adding logs to your application will help you find problems down the road and ultimately improve your and your team's understanding of the data flow in your application. In addition, it can aid in identifying bottlenecks and potential issues long before they occur in the wild. Add timestamps to every log output. Use a human-readable message. Using the correct time is critical to understanding the proper sequence of events, especially if you need to piece together the separate logs of different systems.

  

## [DevOps Roadmap 2022](https://faun.pub/devops-roadmap-2022-340934d360f9)

DevOps Roadmap 2022: DevOps skills are high in demand, and constant learning is required to keep yourself in sync with market demand. Be fundamentally strong in networking technologies. Master Linux, scheduling, and troubleshooting from the command line utilities — awk, sed, jq, yq, curl, ssh, OpenSSL, etc. Master the operating system fundamentals, particularly Linux. Master how to run and orchestrate VMs in Kubernetes. Master various deployment strategies such as blue-green and canary.

  

## [Tracing the History of the Internet, Layer by Layer](https://thenewstack.io/traceroute-podcasts-trace-history-of-internet-layer-by-layer/)

  

Traceroute is a seven-episode podcast series that tells how the Internet came to be through the voices of those who built it and those who documented the story. Episode 1 covers the hardware and software innovations necessary to enable computer networking through the legal and societal changes, like the Telecommunications Act of 1996, that were instrumental to the Internet's success. Then, listen and subscribe to the entire backstory of the creation of the Internet: the origins of the infrastructure: fiber cables that helped bring you this web page built initially to carry oil and gas.

  

## [How To Setup Prometheus and Grafana Monitoring on Kubernetes](https://getbetterdevops.io/setup-prometheus-and-grafana-on-kubernetes/)

Monitoring is a crucial pillar of DevOps best practices to ensure performance and health. It is even more true in a distributed environment such as Kubernetes and microservices. This tutorial shows you how to build a modern monitoring stack with Prometheus & Grafana effectively:

Using the Prometheus Operator, we'll go over what Prometheus is, and the best way to deploy it is using the operator.

We'll see how to set up a monitoring platform with Prometheus and Grafanna.

The Prometheus Operator gains you time on the Prometheus installation and maintainability.

## [AWS Control Tower and Landing Zones: Multi-Account Environments Made (Relatively) Simple](https://aws.plainenglish.io/aws-control-tower-and-landing-zones-multi-account-environments-made-relatively-simple-fad3f2d2d4eb)

AWS Control Tower is an orchestration service that lets you create a multi-account set up in mere minutes. The result is a well-architected "landing zone" that allows you to get up and running right out of the gate. There is minimal customization to get started through the landing zone setup. The setup of your landing zone can take a while but continue reading to see why it is worth it.

  

## [Batching](https://blog.devgenius.io/batching-1e23cc939710)

The book "Accelerate, building and scaling high performing technology organizations" finds a relation between how teams perform and different DORA metrics: multiple deploys per day are related to low lead times and fast reactions when a problem happens in production. More significant changes are required to deploy to production; if nothing is done until you have customer feedback. Big batches are also mapped in the organization, with many different roles in charge of one of those steps.

  

## [Add A WordPress-Style Update Utility To Any Application](https://javascript.plainenglish.io/add-a-wordpress-style-update-utility-to-any-application-48bd33d9b3ff)

Tiger gives you all of the necessary building blocks to have your application package manager up and running in no time. Tiger's Package Manager is a module of the Tiger Platform that you can use to build your self-updating functionality into your downloadable applications quickly. The only actual dependency you need to have is Composer installed and running on your host machine. Unfortunately, this can add a few more setup steps in shared hosting environments since cPanel doesn't offer a feature to install Composer into the user directory.

  

## [Sharding a database can make it faster](https://stackoverflow.blog/2022/03/14/how-sharding-a-database-can-make-it-faster/)

  

Database fragmentation is one of the fastest-developing verticals in the tech industry. Sharding is a technique that splits data into separate databases to distribute traffic. Unfortunately, the complexity that characterizes existing data infrastructures seems to be only getting worse. There are more than 350 database management systems—with many more that didn't even make a list. The database market will only get more fragmented in the near future, says Cevallos. As a result, more and more ideas are coming to the market in the next couple of years.

  

  

## [Understanding Why Resilience Faults in Microservice Applications Occur](https://christophermeiklejohn.com/filibuster/2022/03/19/understanding-faults.html)

  

The first version of Filibuster grew out of my previous Ph.D. work, Partisan. Partisan was an alternative distributed runtime for Erlang explicitly designed for high-performance, large-scale distributed Erlang clusters. After I developed, benchmarked, and released Partisan as open-source, I observed that once you control the distributed runtime and all message transmission, you could inject faults before, during, and after processing messages. For demonstration purposes, I wired this up to Erlang QuickCheck/PropEr to test eventual consistency in a small application.

  

## [Get Started with Kubernetes using kind](https://tech.durgadas.in/get-started-with-kubernetes-using-kind-b9f5a6d122ef)

kind (Kubernetes in Docker) is a tool for running local Kubernetes clusters using Docker container "nodes'" kind was primarily designed for testing and CI testing. It supports creating multiple clusters as opposed to a single cluster in Minikube. It also supports creating an HA-based Kubernetes ecosystem locally. The tool was designed for local development or CI testing and could be very helpful for DevOps trials. You need to have Docker installed and should be up and running.

  

## [Do You Need Multi-Clusters?](https://itnext.io/do-you-need-multi-clusters-6e58556f7f06)

33% of Kubernetes adopters operate 26 clusters or more, and 20% run more than 50 clusters. Multi-clusters are something that all companies should embrace when their services deployed on the cloud have reached a certain level. The single cluster can no longer meet our need to quickly upgrade, introduce new users, and deploy new resources. The blast radius of the single cluster is too big that much effort is needed to bypass our single node failure if a service requires an urgent deployment.

  

  

## [CI/CD, DevOps and Containers: A Winning Trio](https://thenewstack.io/ci-cd-devops-and-containers-a-winning-trio/)

Barak Nissim: DevOps powers the production of better-quality software — and does so faster and more efficiently than before. Containers make it extremely easy to implement a CI/CD pipeline and enable a much more collaborative culture. DevOps is not a technology; it's a methodology. Its goal is to make software development efficient. Containers hold the code and dependencies required to run an application and reside in isolation. That way, teams can develop, test, and deploy apps inside these closed environments. And this doesn't affect different parts of the delivery, which makes the lives of testers and developers a lot easier.

  

## [How to make Docker images even smaller](https://symflower.com/en/company/blog/2022/complete-guide-on-shrinking-container-images/)

Sunflower's container image has grown to a full-size monster with 6.2GB. Here is a step-by-step guide on how you can reduce the size of your container images and how we slimmed down our large monster image. This article is not just a bunch of tips but is meant as a complete guide with information on how to slim down your container image. If you find a step that we missed towards a smaller image size: tell us! We will extend the article, so the next person benefits from your feedback.

  

## [What Is Helm? A Quickstart Tutorial for Kubernetes Beginners](https://getbetterdevops.io/helm-quickstart-tutorial/)

Kubernetes is a must for DevOps practitioners for orchestrating containers. Learn Helm by practice in this tutorial. Understand what Helm is and how to package an app with Helm charts. Manage upgrades and rollbacks in Kubernetes with Helm. Use Helm charts to create an application that can be compressed and sent to a remote repository for reusability and sharing. Helm provides you the ability to install applications with a single command. A chart can contain other charts as a dependency. You can use the same chart for multiple dev, staging, and production environments.

  

## [Less Known GitHub Alternatives…](https://faun.pub/less-known-github-alternatives-49f9c9eff4bb)

Some platforms deserve more attention due to various reasons. GitHub can suppress any of its competitors without regard to the basic features and the product itself. That being said, here are some alternatives to GitHub which should be popular. Launchpad is a free alternative to FREE/ PAID versions of Github used by thousands of people for code collaboration and project management. CodeCommit is a secure, highly scalable, managed source control service hosts private Git repositories. It makes it easy for teams to securely collaborate on code with contributions encrypted in transit and at rest. Launchpad lets you host support benefits on any hardware version you are currently using.

  

## [Distributed System Question: How To Detect a Dead Node](https://edward-huang.com/distributed-system/2022/03/17/how-to-detect-a-dead-node-in-a-distributed-system/)

Detecting if a Node is dead sounds like a straightforward process. However, it is a tricky process to do. We often granted third-party cloud services having this simple feature to help us monitor our node's health. We will also discuss a high-level architecture design for detecting a node failure with phi accrual. The following action will wait for a particular time until a retry or retry option may be better as making any more effort if you get no response may cause unwanted effects.

  

## [Detecting silent errors in the wild: Combining two novel approaches to quickly detect silent data corruptions at scale](https://engineering.fb.com/2022/03/17/production-engineering/silent-errors/)

We've seen in our research that both approaches are equally important to each other, and we can't predict the next generation of the Internet or determine what the Internet will look like. So we rely on each other's ability to predict the future of the web, and the Internet itself, to make sense.

  

## [Shrinking Go executables](https://itnext.io/shrinking-go-executable-9e9c17b47a41)

You can shrink Go executables using Go 1.18 and UPX with a reasonable building time. You can make your executables as small as possible with UPX, but the packing time grows like a mad when using the best, brute, and ultra-brute parameters. 3.5MB is the smallest size. UPX can compress this particular executable to about 21% of the original size. The second row with go-build flags is the fastest, and the shortest is the second row. When using --best --lzma, the time is 7.25 seconds.

  

  

  

## [Technical Debt: How do you get out of the bottleneck?](https://martinfowler.com/articles/bottlenecks-of-scaleups/01-tech-debt.html#exit)

This article is the first in a series that examines these bottlenecks. In each piece, we'll look at how startups get into the bottleneck, usually through doing the right things that are needed early in a startup's life but are no longer right as growth changes the context for ways of working. Next, we'll highlight key signs that the startup is approaching or stuck in the bottleneck. The most common scaling bottleneck we encounter is technical debt - startups regularly state that tech debt is their main impediment to growth.

  

## [I discovered thousands of open databases on AWS](https://infosecwriteups.com/how-i-discovered-thousands-of-open-databases-on-aws-764729aa7f32)

ElasticSearch REST API is very convenient. It is easy to get the fields metadata, documents count, and everything you want to know about the ES cluster. ElasticSearch-dump can be used to back up (and restore) the database. Some of the assets I've discovered were already "hacked" (not hacked, more but malformed, by RansomWare. The company was in the middle (or peak) of their due-diligence process, reporting they raised quite a lot of money just a few weeks after I wrote this incident. That could have been fatal for them if someone else had found it.

  

## [Is Bun The Next Big Thing After WebPack?](https://betterprogramming.pub/is-bun-the-next-big-thing-after-webpack-d683441f77b9)

The Vite 2.0 project uses esbuild behind the scenes to deliver a performant building experience. Bun is meant to make the whole JavaScript development even faster. It is not yet production-ready, but this tool's future is looking bright. The bun tool does support out-of-the-box complex features like TypeScript, CSS in Js, JSX, and JSX. However, it still lacks some basic features like Source Maps, Tree-shaking, etc.

  

## [Cluster.dev: All-in-One Tool for Cloud Native Infrastructure](https://itnext.io/cluster-dev-all-in-one-tool-for-cloud-native-infrastructure-636ed6ba8e28)

Cluster.dev: All-in-One Tool for Cloud Native Infrastructure. Bundle Terraform, Helm, ArgoCD, and more in a simple framework to create and manage end-to-end infrastructure. Clusterdev uses a "Stack Template" to define all the infrastructure pieces in a familiar declarative manifest approach. A stack template can be anything from a Terraform module to shell scripts, shell charts, helm charts, and even OPA/Kyverno policies. A team backs the tool from Ukraine with members who have managed to evacuate from Kyiv and are currently safe.

  

## [Scheduling Execution in PHP](https://dariuszgafka.medium.com/scheduling-execution-in-php-e9e5023b793c)

This article will go deep into different ways of scheduling execution in PHP. Scheduled Batch Jobs are implemented mainly by Cron Jobs, which executes the process. However, having a system cron job often creates problems with tracking if something goes wrong and requires running a non-PHP process. Therefore, ecotone brings Scheduled Jobs into PHP. The most common approach is scheduled batch jobs that rise at a specific hour. In most cases, it executes big database queries and performs related actions. This article assumes basic knowledge about Commands and Events.

  

## [The Rules of Clean and (Mostly) Painless Migrations](https://itnext.io/the-rules-of-clean-and-mostly-painless-migrations-75b8b0dec194)

The Rules of Clean and (Mostly) Painless Database Migrations are the rules to follow for clean and (mostly) painless migrations. Some of these are more important than others, and some may feel that some are unnecessary. All migrations should be idempotent, meaning you can run them many times without failing. If migration has the potential to lock tables or exhaust resources (like CPU), be sure to deploy it outside of business hours (and remember different US time zones)

  

## [Tips for Reducing Initial Render Latency of Single-Page Applications](https://betterprogramming.pub/tips-for-reducing-initial-render-latency-of-single-page-applications-1929f0043af2)

Single-Page Applications are cursed with slow loading because they download the files they need. Lazy Loading and Code-Splitting is the process of loading parts of your application when you need them instead of loading the whole thing at once. Code-splitting is about instructing your module bundler to split the JavaScript into logical bundles rather than jam-packing the full JavaScript into one file. It will create different files that will be downloaded only when we perform actions on the app that need those files; they will be lazy-loaded.
