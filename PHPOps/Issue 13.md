## [How to use Laravel Sail with the Docker Desktop WSL 2 backend](https://codeburst.io/how-to-use-laravel-sail-with-the-docker-desktop-wsl-2-backend-3768a126a85)

In general, Docker and containers are something every developer has to get familiar with sooner or later. Let’s take a look at installing Docker Desktop on Windows 10, how it integrates with Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) 2, and how to use Laravel’s new command-line tool Laravel Sail to get up and running with Laravel in no time.

## [DevOps vs Site Reliability Engineering: Concepts, Practices, and Roles](https://www.altexsoft.com/blog/devops-vs-site-reliability-engineering/)

For over a decade, two similar concepts — DevOps and Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) — have been coexisting in the world of software development. At first glance, they may look like competitors. But a closer view reveals that alleged rivals are actually complementary pieces of a puzzle that fit together nicely.

## [A Guide to Securing Google Kubernetes Engine](https://scalesec.com/blog/a-guide-to-securing-google-kubernetes-engine/)

It is no secret that organizations are striving to move their applications into containers. According to Mordor Intelligence, the application container market is expected to grow over 29% within the next five years with Kubernetes achieving a growth of 48%. Companies such as Google and Amazon are at the forefront of enabling this effort offering customers managed Kubernetes services. With this large growth in the Kubernetes space, security needs to be top of mind.

## [API’s From Dev to Production](https://dev.to/newday-technology/api-s-from-dev-to-production-428i)

Welcome to a blog post series that will go from the most basic example of a .net 5 webapi in C#, and the journey from development to production with a shift-left mindset. We will use Azure, Docker, GitHub, GitHub Actions for CI/C-Deployment and Infrastructure as Code using Pulumi.

## [Building Custom Applications using Rapid Application Development (RAD)](https://medium.com/codestory/building-custom-applications-using-rapid-application-development-rad-3c0bcbbd46d)

The traditional waterfall model of software development often proves to be a buttoned-down and inflexible approach. Over the years, developers have realized that the waterfall model’s strict planning routine makes it difficult to maintain client timelines and incorporate their feedback. Hence, the Rapid Application Development (RAD) model was introduced.

## [How to Deploy a Basic Spring Application In Google App Engine](https://medium.com/javarevisited/how-to-deploy-a-basic-spring-application-in-google-app-engine-9a7842c943d5)

In this tutorial, We will take a basic Springboot Application without any database, to demonstrate how to deploy the app in Google App Engine in minutes.

## [EKS — Security Groups for Pods](https://swade1987.medium.com/eks-security-groups-for-pods-38bd0fed14a6)

Containerised applications running in Kubernetes frequently require access to other services running within the cluster as well as external AWS services, such as Amazon RDS or Amazon Elasticache Redis. On AWS, controlling network level access between services is often accomplished via EC2 security groups. Before a few months ago, you could only assign security groups at the node level, and every pod on a node shared the same security groups.

## [The Road to Reactive: Understanding the Temporal and Spatial Decoupling](https://medium.com/event-driven-utopia/the-road-to-reactive-understanding-the-temporal-and-spatial-decoupling-1fd49f52229a)

Please don’t mind the title. It seems it is coming straight out of a quantum physics paper. Have no fear; we are not going to talk physics here.  
Even though temporal and spatial decoupling sounds too scientific, they don’t carry much weight as they appear to be. It’s about being independent of time and space.

## [{ Zero to Helm } — Part One: History](https://stephnr.medium.com/zero-to-helm-part-one-history-f3f9b7112bed)

Welcome to the first entry of the { Zero to Helm } series! On this weeks byte, we will be going over a brief recap of some of the greatest moments Kubernetes has had from the past two decades. Yes, you read that right — the origins of Kubernetes stems back as far as the year 2003 with a system known as Borg! But don’t fret, we will make sure to keep you up to speed with some recent history too and maybe some insight into what might come next!

## [AWS Automation: AMI scheduling](https://edgardo-cj.medium.com/aws-automation-ami-scheduling-62c6e037665a)

Therefore, given the big problem and perhaps the need for a solution, I decided to write this automation to provide a mechanism for safely backing up your instances state through AMI scheduling.

## [HAProxy Kubernetes Ingress Controller Moves Outside the Cluster](https://thenewstack.io/haproxy-kubernetes-ingress-controller-moves-outside-the-cluster/)

The HAProxy Kubernetes Ingress Controller has been around since the release of HAProxy 2.0 in 2019, with nearly 40 minor updates in the year and a half since, and now the project has its first major update with the release of HAProxy Kubernetes Ingress Controller 1.5.

## [Uncovering a 24-year-old bug in the Linux Kernel](https://engineering.skroutz.gr/blog/uncovering-a-24-year-old-bug-in-the-linux-kernel/)

As part of our standard toolkit, we provide each developer at Skroutz with a writable database snapshot against which she can develop. These snapshots are updated daily through a pipeline that involves taking an LVM snapshot of production data, anonymizing the dataset by stripping all personal data, and transferring it via rsync to the development database servers. The development servers in turn use ZFS snapshots to expose a copy-on-write snapshot to each developer, with self-service tools allowing rollback or upgrades to newer snapshots.

## [Patterns of Distributed Systems (2020)](https://martinfowler.com/articles/patterns-of-distributed-systems/)

Distributed systems provide a particular challenge to program. They often require us to have multiple copies of data, which need to keep synchronized. Yet we cannot rely on processing nodes working reliably, and network delays can easily lead to inconsistencies. Despite this, many organizations rely on a range of core distributed software handling data storage, messaging, system management, and compute capability. These systems face common problems which they solve with similar solutions. This article recognizes and develops these solutions as patterns, with which we can build up an understanding of how to better understand, communicate and teach distributed system design.

## [Basic CI, CD Setup using AWS — CodeCommit, CodePipeline, & Elastic Beanstalk as deploy provider.](https://medium.com/@santhukan67/basic-ci-cd-setup-using-aws-codecommit-codepipeline-elastic-beanstalk-as-deploy-provider-792a4c58acfd)

In this article, we’ll be setting up a simple (nothing fancy) CI, CD setup using AWS — CodeCommit, CodePipeline & CodeDeploy. I’ll be assuming that you have a basic idea about what is CI, CD and basic services of AWS. To make it simple we are skipping the CodeBuild step which is used for Test & Build the packages that are ready to deploy.

## [AWS CloudFormation For Beginners with Examples](https://devops4solutions.medium.com/aws-cloudformation-for-beginners-with-examples-6162233e7102)

In this blog we will explore AWS CloudFormation with examples.

## [Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) vs. DevOps: Focus, Differences, Similarities, and Practices](https://miryali.medium.com/site-reliability-engineering-sre-vs-devops-focus-differences-similarities-and-practices-21b6172d8b45)

However, downtime is not the only D-word in the IT industry. Delays in rolling out new features, bug fixes, vulnerability fixes, enhancements, and so on, can drive the customers to the competition. Naturally, IT teams are under extraordinary pressure to minimize downtime and delays in delivering IT services to their users. Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) and DevOps emerged as organic and natural solutions to this challenge.

## [Buildpacks vs. Dockerfiles](https://technology.doximity.com/articles/buildpacks-vs-dockerfiles)

When deploying to our platform, the first step is to containerize the application. Containerizing an application allows us to deploy and run it in a repeatable and reliable manner by packaging the application with its dependencies. Containerization also includes making configuration choices that enable an application to run better in a container environment, like logging to stdout. The outcome of containerizing an application is an image. Once a team has an image, they can run their application on the platform. But how do they get that image?

## [Breaking the database CI speed limit with Spawn](https://medium.com/spawn-db/breaking-the-database-ci-speed-limit-with-spawn-442fefe22462)

It can often feel like your continuous integration (CI) environment has an artificial speed limit on it when you’ve got databases involved. Databases sat on infrastructure to support CI are likely to slow you down due to contention for the resource, or artificially limiting access to prevent concurrent tests from interfering with one another.
