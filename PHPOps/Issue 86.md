## [This Week in Programming: GitHub Copilot Tests the Copyleft](https://thenewstack.io/this-week-in-programming-github-copilot-tests-the-copyleft/)

Some in the open-source community criticize GitHub for charging for its Copilot service, which assists developers with code completion. They argue that this appropriates open-source intellectual property and that developers who care about open-source software should cut ties with GitHub altogether.

## [What are Docker, Containers, Virtual Machines, and Containerization?](https://blog.devgenius.io/what-are-docker-containers-virtual-machines-and-containerization-e68bf076edf4)

Containerization bundles the software code with all its libraries, frameworks, and other dependencies so it can be packaged and shipped as a single entity.

Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications that enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure.

Containers and virtual machines are very similar resource virtualization technologies. However, the key differentiator between containers and virtual machines is that virtual machines virtualize an entire machine down to the hardware layers, and containers only virtualize software layers above the operating system level.

  

## [Secure Coding: An Introduction to Principles and Practices](https://blog.magda-on-cyber.com/secure-coding-an-introduction-to-principles-and-practices-c4d491018928)

The principles of secure coding are guidelines that should be followed when writing code. These guidelines help reduce the chances of vulnerabilities in your applications. Some common coding standards include the Secure Coding Guidelines from the CERT Coordination Center, the Microsoft Security Development Lifeline, and the OWASP Top Ten. In addition, good design is important for security, as it can help to reduce the chances of vulnerabilities in your code. Following coding standards and good design, practices can help make your applications more secure.

## [Terraform at Scale: Manage Multiple Accounts](https://medium.com/@whitehead.pauljay/terraform-at-scale-manage-multiple-accounts-7c5bd0c54e4b)

To manage Terraform state for multiple accounts, you can use a hub and spoke pattern with AWS to assume roles. You will need to create an IAM role named terraform-state in the hub account and configure the minimum permissions for the IAM policy. You will also need to create an IAM role named terraform-admin in all accounts whose resources will be managed by Terraform. The terraform-admin role will need to trust the terraform-state role. Finally, you will need to configure the AWS provider to assume a role in the
