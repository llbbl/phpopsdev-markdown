## [Scaling Kubernetes to 7,500 Nodes](https://openai.com/blog/scaling-kubernetes-to-7500-nodes/)

We‚Äôve scaled Kubernetes clusters to 7,500 nodes, producing a scalable infrastructure for large models like GPT-3, CLIP, and DALL¬∑E, but also for rapid small-scale iterative research such as Scaling Laws for Neural Language Models. Scaling a single Kubernetes cluster to this size is rarely done and requires some special care, but the upside is a simple infrastructure that allows our machine learning research teams to move faster and scale up without changing their code.

## [Monitoring vs. Observability: Can You Tell The Difference?](https://dashbird.io/blog/monitoring-vs-observability/)

Observability has gained a lot of popularity in recent years. Modern DevOps paradigms encourage building robust applications by incorporating automation, Infrastructure as Code, and agile development. To assess the health and ‚Äúrobustness‚Äù of IT systems, engineering teams typically use logs, metrics, and traces, which are used by various developer tools to facilitate observability. But what is observability exactly, and how does it differ from monitoring?

CI/CD (continuous integration and Continuous Delivery/Deployment) is part of the fabric of our lives. We go to conferences about CI/CD, we write articles and blog about CI/CD, we list CI/CD on our LinkedIn page. Nobody even debates about whether it‚Äôs the right thing to do or not. We are all on the same page. Right?

Basically, bring up those AWS resources like EC2 instances, DBs, etc; and tear them down when you don‚Äôt need them; this blog post is something that might be for you.

## [The Tech Debt Playbook](https://cgroom.medium.com/the-tech-debt-playbook-4e0b2e4c034a)

All software teams have technical debt ‚Äî parts of the code that weren‚Äôt created with today‚Äôs challenges in mind, or were written poorly, or were expedient hacks that are now problematic. Having tech debt isn‚Äôt necessarily a bad thing; if people spent all their time making code perfect, nothing would ever get done. But too much accumulated debt makes it slower to deliver new features and is a source of bugs and quality issues.
