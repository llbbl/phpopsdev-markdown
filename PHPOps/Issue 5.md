## [Amazon EKS Distro (EKS-D): The Kubernetes Distribution Used by Amazon EKS](https://medium.com/@gokulchandrapr/amazon-eks-distro-eks-d-the-kubernetes-distribution-used-by-amazon-eks-fa23b54025fb)

Amazon at the re:Invent 2020 virtual event made strategic announcements related to container services, the announcement include EKS-A (EKS Anywhere), EKS-C (EKS Console), ECS-A (ECS Anywhere) and EKS-D (EKS Distro). While EKS-A, EKS-C, ECS-A are expected to be available in 2021, AWS open sourced EKS-D — Kubernetes distribution that powers its Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS).

## [The Cloud Native Landscape: The Orchestration and Management Layer](https://thenewstack.io/the-cloud-native-landscape-the-orchestration-and-management-layer/)

The orchestration and management layer is the third layer in the Cloud Native Computing Foundation’s cloud native landscape. Before tackling tools in this category, engineers have presumably already automated infrastructure provisioning following security and compliance standards (provisioning layer) and set up the runtime for the application (runtime layer). Now they must figure out how to orchestrate and manage all app components as a group. Components must identify one another to communicate and coordinate to accomplish a common goal. Inherently scalable, cloud native apps rely on automation and resilience, enabled by these tools.

## [Amazon Web Services Takes the Silicon Wars to the Cloud](https://thenewstack.io/amazon-web-services-takes-the-silicon-wars-to-the-cloud/)

Amazon Web Services’ (AWS) Peter DeSantis, senior vice president of global infrastructure and customer support, during his keynote at the cloud giant’s AWS Re:Invent, annual user event asserted that AWS’ processor and chip designs are superior for cloud-application performance, compared to processors CPU giants AMD and Intel provide while adding that AWS’s graphics processor performance beats that of GPUs that Nvidia — a leading GPU supplier — offers for machine learning (ML). He was referring to AWS Graviton2 processors, which are custom built by Amazon Web Services using 64-bit Arm Neoverse

## [CentOS dropped because it “was not [..] providing [..] usefulness to Red Hat”](https://www.itprotoday.com/linux/community-concerns-prompt-red-hat-drop-centos-centos-stream)

Red Hat's decision earlier to stop development of the Linux distribution CentOS to concentrate on CentOS Stream has created a brouhaha on social media. That's because it has IT pros who are dependent on the popular server operating system scurrying to figure how best to replace it now that Red Hat and the CentOS board have announced that at the end of 2021, CentOS as a Red Hat Enterprise Linux clone will cease to exist.

## [The Top 10 CI/CD Pipeline Implementation Challenges And Solutions](https://www.lambdatest.com/blog/cicd-pipeline-challenges/)

CI/CD pipelines have become the mainstream approach to software development across the entire IT sector. There’s no doubt that CI/CD pipeline tools have matured a lot over the years. Yet, developers, QA engineers, and leaders are still posed with some challenges and roadblocks in adopting and efficiently implementing CI/CD tools. This article highlights the top 10 CI/CD challenges that people face during implementation, and we will also discuss their potential solutions.

## [Get to know about “The Twelve-Factor App”](https://medium.com/@6131305012/get-to-know-about-the-twelve-factor-app-77f25f2ed2b9)

Twelve Factor is a methodology for building software-as-a-service applications. These best practices are designed to enable applications to be built with portability and resilience when deployed to the web.

## [Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus](https://aws.amazon.com/prometheus/)

Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus (AMP) is a Prometheus-compatible monitoring service that makes it easy to monitor containerized applications at scale. The Cloud Native Computing Foundation’s Prometheus project is a popular open source monitoring and alerting solution optimized for container environments. With AMP, you can use the open source Prometheus query language (PromQL) to monitor the performance of containerized workloads, without having to manage the underlying infrastructure. AMP automatically scales the ingestion, storage, and querying of operational metrics as workloads grow or shrink, and is integrated with AWS security services to enable fast and secure access to data. The service is integrated with Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS), Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS), and AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry.

## [Build a modern Web Application](https://dev.to/edwardmercado/build-a-modern-web-application-3o4f)

There's a lot of aspects you need to consider to call it a modern web application. For me, the most important one is that your application can dynamically alter their own content without loading a new document and can handle large to intermittent shifts of traffic to meet the demands.

## [3 Reasons Traditional Approaches to App Security Need an Upgrade](https://thenewstack.io/3-reasons-traditional-approaches-to-app-security-need-an-upgrade/)

Dynamic multiclouds are the platform of choice for digital transformation, with DevOps accelerating deployment speeds for new releases and cloud native applications becoming increasingly interconnected. But, as a recent research study of CIOs around the world reveals, the pace of digital transformation is driving overwhelming levels of complexity in these environments. According to the research, 89% of CIOs say digital transformation has accelerated over the past 12 months, with 86% attributing that increase to adopting cloud native technologies — including containers, microservices and Kubernetes. All of this has resulted in what two-thirds of CIOs say is a dynamic multicloud environment that is so complex it is now beyond human ability to manage.

## [Kubernetes : Labels and Annotation](https://devops4solutions.medium.com/kubernetes-labels-and-annotation-3bb0a5a22193)

In this blog, we will explore how to check the health of the pods using Liveness and Readiness Probe

## [HashiCorp and AWS Launch Quick Start Guides for Vault 1.6 on Amazon EKS and EC2](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/hashicorp-and-aws-launch-vault-eks-and-amazon-ec2-quick-start-guides)

Two AWS quick start guides for HashiCorp Vault on EKS and EC2 are now updated for compatibility with Vault 1.6.

## [Terraform: Transforming code to infrastructure](https://omkarbirade.medium.com/terraform-transforming-code-to-infrastructure-26c565a82b94)
